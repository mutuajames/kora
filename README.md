# Kora — Config-Driven Application Engine

Define your application — data model, permissions, workflows — in YAML. Kora gives you a database, REST API, React admin UI, and background jobs. No code generation.

## Quick Start

```bash
make dev                           # MySQL + build + setup + serve
```

Or step by step:

```bash
docker compose up -d mysql         # Start MySQL
make build                         # Build UI + Go binary
make setup                         # Setup airtime site
make serve                         # Start server on :8000
```

Open **http://localhost:8000/workspace** — login with `admin@airtime.local` / `admin123`.

### All Make Commands

```
make dev          Full setup: MySQL + build + setup + serve
make build        Build UI + Go binary
make serve        Start server
make setup        Setup a site (override: SITE=fieldwork.local CONFIG=config/fieldwork/)
make test         Run Go tests
make lint         Run linters (Go + TypeScript)
make fmt          Format code (go fmt + prettier)
make release      Tag and push a release (TAG=v0.2.0)
make clean        Remove build artifacts
make help         Show all commands
```

Open **http://localhost:8000/workspace** — login with `admin@airtime.local` / `admin123`.

## Multi-Site

```
http://localhost:8000/s/airtime/workspace     → Airtime app
http://localhost:8000/s/fieldwork/workspace   → Fieldwork app
http://localhost:8000/console/login           → System console
```

No DNS or `/etc/hosts` needed. Path-based routing just works. For production, add real domains — Host-based routing takes over automatically.
